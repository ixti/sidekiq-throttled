Concurrency and threshold throttling for [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/).


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "sidekiq-throttled"
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install sidekiq-throttled
```


## Usage

Add somewhere in your app's bootstrap (e.g. `config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` if
you are using Rails):

``` ruby
require "sidekiq/throttled"
Sidekiq::Throttled.setup!
```

Once you've done that you can include `Sidekiq::Throttled::Worker` to your
job classes and configure throttling:

``` ruby
class MyWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker
  include Sidekiq::Throttled::Worker

  sidekiq_options :queue => :my_queue

  sidekiq_throttle({
    # Allow maximum 10 concurrent jobs of this class at a time.
    :concurrency => { :limit => 10 },
    # Allow maximum 1K jobs being processed within one hour window.
    :threshold => { :limit => 1_000, :period => 1.hour }
  })

  def perform
    # ...
  end
end
```


### Dynamic throttling

You can throttle jobs dynamically with `:key_suffix` option:

``` ruby
class MyWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker
  include Sidekiq::Throttled::Worker

  sidekiq_options :queue => :my_queue

  sidekiq_throttle({
    # Allow maximum 10 concurrent jobs per user at a time.
    :concurrency => { :limit => 10, :key_suffix => -> (user_id) { user_id } }
  })

  def perform(user_id)
    # ...
  end
end
```

You can also supply dynamic values for limits and periods by supplying a proc for these values. The proc will be evaluated at the time the job is fetched and will receive the same arguments that are passed to the job.

``` ruby
class MyWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker
  include Sidekiq::Throttled::Worker

  sidekiq_options :queue => :my_queue

  sidekiq_throttle({
    # Allow maximum 1000 concurrent jobs of this class at a time for VIPs and 10 for all other users.
    :concurrency => { :limit => User.vip?(user_id) ? 1_000 : 10 },
    # Allow 1000 jobs/hour to be processed for VIPs and 10/day for all others
    :threshold => { :limit => ->(user_id) { User.vip?(user_id) ? 1_000 : 10 }, :period => ->(user_id) { User.vip?(user_id) ? 1.hour : 1.day }
  })

  def perform(user_id)
    # ...
  end
end
```
